# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project delivers a complete, reproducible exploratory analysis of a large real-world electric vehicle (EV) dataset.
The goal is clear: transform raw, inconsistent data into trustworthy, statistically validated insights.

Important Note: The source of the dataset used in this project is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Real EV datasets often suffer from:

Missing or inconsistent values

Conflicting range and price information

Outliers that distort market insights

Non-standard formatting across fields

Regional and manufacturer-based variability

Lack of validated relationships between key variables

Such issues prevent companies from understanding EV adoption trends, pricing dynamics, and performance patterns.

This project directly addresses these challenges.

## 💡 What Problems Does This Project Solve?

✔ Unclean and inconsistent data → Cleaned, validated, and structured dataset
✔ Hidden anomalies → Detected through IQR, Z-score, and Mahalanobis methods
✔ Unreliable missing data → Diagnosed (MCAR test) and imputed with MICE + KNN
✔ Unclear relationships → Verified through t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-Square, and correlation
✔ Lack of domain transparency → Engineered features for better interpretability
✔ Fragmented EV market signals → Regions, counties, makes, and price segments analyzed

The result is a dataset ready for:

Market analysis

Forecasting

Machine learning

Policy evaluation

Consumer segmentation

## 🌟 Value Proposition — Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates the capability to bring order, structure, and clarity to real-world messy data.
It showcases:

Analytical decision-making through statistical validation

Industry relevance by uncovering EV market behaviors

Reliable preprocessing for downstream machine learning

Business value through improved insights into EV range, pricing, and adoption patterns

End-to-end data handling, from raw input to insight-ready output

In short:
I don’t just analyze data — I make it usable, trustworthy, and insightful.
